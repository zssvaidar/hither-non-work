Key Difference Between Procedural and Object Oriented Programming
Now that we’ve introduced both paradigms, let’s compare them more directly:

Organization: Procedural programming uses functions to organize code, while OOP uses objects and classes.
Data Handling: Procedural programming often relies on global data, whereas OOP encapsulates data within objects.
Reusability: OOP encourages reusability through inheritance and polymorphism, making it easier to extend and maintain code.
Complexity: OOP tends to be more suitable for complex systems where data and behavior need to be tightly connected.
Real-World Analogy: Procedural programming is like following a recipe, while OOP is like building with LEGO bricks.
